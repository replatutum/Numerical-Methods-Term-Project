SVD-Based digital image watermark embedding/extracting scheme

The digital watermarking scheme proposed by Chang et al. in 2005 aims to soften the loss of image quality by a singular value decomposition (SVD) based watermarking procedure. This project is a Python implementation of the same algorithm with minor differences.
